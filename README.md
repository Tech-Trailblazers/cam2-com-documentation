## 🌍 Why This Repository Matters

Chemicals power our industries and homes, but they also come with risks:

- ⚠️ Hazards like flammability, reactivity, or toxicity
- 🧑‍⚕️ Poisoning or accidental exposure emergencies
- 🔥 Fire and explosion dangers
- 🌱 Environmental damage if spilled or misused

This repository exists to help **educate, protect, and prepare** people across the world 🌎. SDS/MSDS documents are **life-saving resources** because they explain exactly:

- What chemicals are inside a product
- How to use them safely 🧤
